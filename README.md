This is a machine vision project contain a novel method for authentication people by ear captured image. Its method is based on geometric feature vector that collect from main point of external hilex of ears and with a KNN selector, it can detect persons identification. With that I design a GUI for work better and create a system that attach to this method. also its method is based on Q1-Rank papre "A novel geometric feature extraction method for ear recognition"
